# C_Sandbox
Just a repository for all of my here-and-there C projects.

## stack_to_heap.c
2/18/2024, STATUS: INCOMPLETE
Using a fixed-size buffer (character array of size 50), take in infinite user input strings, condense them to strings of appropriate length based on user-input, save them in a dynamically-sized array along with their size somehow.

## diag_traversal.c
2/19/2025, STATUS: COMPLETE
An algorithm to diagonally traverse a 2-dimensional array from southwest to northeast.

## J_Class_Test
A mockup of how classes work in Java with C implementation. The OBJ.h file is meant to represent a "class" with it's fields and functions, the new.c file is meant to test the OBJ_new method to add an "object" to an "arraylist" without needing a reference to a variable. Therefore replicating the "new" keyword in Java. There is also implementation of adding an object to a dynamically-sized array during runtime, but this is not relevant to the project's focus.
